# Streaming Data Pipeline with Spark, Kafka, and Cassandra

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a robust and scalable streaming data pipeline using cutting-edge technologies like **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Spark**, and **Apache Cassandra**, orchestrated with **Apache Airflow** and deployed using **Docker**.

The system is designed to handle real-time data ingestion, processing, and storage, catering to use cases requiring low-latency processing and high-throughput scalability.

---

## System Architecture
The pipeline architecture follows a modular and distributed approach, ensuring reliability and scalability:

1. **Apache Airflow**: Acts as the orchestrator to manage and schedule data pipeline tasks.
2. **Apache Kafka**: Serves as the data broker for streaming data, leveraging **ZooKeeper** for cluster management.
3. **Schema Registry**: Ensures consistency in the data structure across producers and consumers.
4. **Apache Spark**: Processes the real-time data streams in a distributed manner, utilizing a master-worker architecture.
5. **Apache Cassandra**: Stores the processed data in a scalable, highly available NoSQL database optimized for read and write performance.
6. **Docker**: Encapsulates all components into containers for seamless deployment and integration.

## Key Features
- **Streaming Ingestion**: Kafka enables real-time data ingestion from various sources.
- **Data Processing**: Spark performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks on streaming data.
- **Scalable Storage**: Cassandra ensures efficient data storage with replication and partitioning for fault tolerance.
- **Orchestration**: Airflow schedules and monitors the pipeline workflow.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrated tools for monitoring and debugging pipeline performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Streaming**: Apache Kafka, ZooKeeper
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark
- **Data Storage**: Apache Cassandra
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Apache Airflow
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Version Control**: Git

## Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Real-time data is produced and ingested into Kafka topics.
2. **Data Processing**: Spark streaming applications consume the Kafka data, process it, and transform it into actionable insights.
3. **Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in Cassandra tables for further analysis or retrieval.
4. **Orchestration**: Airflow manages the end-to-end pipeline workflow, including error handling and retries.
5. **Monitoring**: Control Center and logs help track the data flow and debug issues.

## Use Cases
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Monitoring live metrics for business intelligence.
- **Log Aggregation**: Collecting and processing log data for anomaly detection.
- **IoT Data Processing**: Handling sensor data streams from connected devices.
- **E-commerce**: Tracking user behavior and providing personalized recommendations.
